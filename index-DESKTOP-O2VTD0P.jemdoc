== News
- \[September 2023\] Welcome Gengshuo Chang and Lehan Zhang to join our group.

- \[September 2023\] Our paper "Successful Recovery Performance Guarantees of SOMP Under the L2-Norm of Noise" is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology.
 
#In this paper, we present a new mutual incoherence property (MIP)-based study for performance analysis of noisy SOMP when the measurement matrix and sparse signal are deterministic.
Specifically, when noise is bounded, we provide the condition on which the exact support recovery is guaranteed in terms of the MIP.
When noise is unbounded, we instead derive a bound on the successful recovery probability (SRP) that depends on the specific distribution of the $\ell_2$-norm of the noise matrix.
Then we focus on the typical case when noise is random Gaussian, and show that the lower bound of SRP follows Tracy-Widom law distribution.
The analysis reveals the number of measurements, noise level, the number of sparse vectors, and the value of mutual coherence that are required to guarantee a predefined recovery performance.

== About me
I am an assistant professor of Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen. Before that, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, working with [https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/wptay/ Prof. Tay Wee Peng]. Before this, I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the City University of Hong Kong (CityU), supervised by with [https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~shleung/ Prof. Shu-Hung Leung] and [http://ittc.ku.edu/~tjkim/ Prof. Taejoon Kim].
I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2013 and 2015, respectively. 

== Education 
- Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Sep. 2015 - Oct. 2019
- M.S. in Information and Comunication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Sep. 2013 - Jun. 2015
- B.S. in Communication Enginnering, Harbin Institute of Technology (Hornor School), Sep. 2009 - Jun. 2013

== Research Interests 
My researchs focus on low-rank matrix recovery and its application in millimeter wave channel estimation. The current research topics include:
